This is a game with two players where each player rolls a dice and dice values gets added on to reach the desired value (I set it to 20).
- Once you roll the dice, you can keep your value to guarantee but then it is the other players turn.
- You can take risk an keep rolling without keeping your points but there is a chance that you can roll 1 and if you roll 1, all your points will be erased and it will be again the other players turn.
